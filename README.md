# Advent of Code
Solutions to 2015's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
Code known to be compatible with ``rustc 1.7.0-nightly``.

Earlier solutions are most likely more verbose or use non-idiomatic language features since I used these as an
excuse to work with Rust. Feedback is welcome. I tried to make the solutions reasonably efficient (around one
second on my machine), but make sure to compile them in Release mode.
